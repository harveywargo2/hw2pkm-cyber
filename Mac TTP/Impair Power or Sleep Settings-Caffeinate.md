## Notable
To prevent a Mac from sleeping while running a script, use the caffeinate command with the -i flag to inhibit idle sleep and the -w flag to wait for the script to finish.

For example:

```

caffeinate -i -w $$ your_script.sh.

```

The double dollar signs represents the current process ID, ensuring caffeinate stays active until the script completes.

You can also use caffeinate in utility mode, where you don't need to provide a pid, but a utility that should be executed.

E.g. wrap your work in a shell script mywork.sh and:

```
caffeinate -disu mywork.sh
```

  

Fork/Pin to Process

```
caffeinate -i [command / process]

caffeinate -i ssh coffeebeans &

caffeinate -i make

caffeinate -i /private/tmp/./whatisthis.sh

caffeinate -i /Applications/Safari.app/Resources/MacOS/Safari

caffeinate -d telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl

```

caffeinate -i &

caffeinate -i <your_command_here>
```

  

## Command Flags

Flag -d
- Prevents the display from sleeping, even if the system is idle. The display will remain on, but the system may still go to sleep.

Flag -i
- Prevents the system from going into idle sleep. The system will stay awake, but the display might still sleep if idle.

Flag -m
- Prevents the hard drive from going to sleep. This is useful for tasks that involve disk access.

Flag -s
- Prevents the system from sleeping when it is connected to AC power. This is a more forceful sleep prevention than -i.

Flag -t
- <timeout> Sets a timeout in seconds for the caffeinate command. After the timeout expires, caffeinate will exit, and the system will revert to its normal sleep behavior. For example, caffeinate -t 3600 will prevent sleep for one hour.

Flag -u
- Declares user activity, which also prevents sleep. If the display is off, this option will turn it on and prevent it from sleeping for the specified timeout (defaulting to 5 seconds if not used with -t).


Flag -w
- <pid> Prevents the system from sleeping until the process with the specified process ID (PID) exits. This is useful for preventing sleep while a specific long-running process is active.

From the Mac developer library, the differences between idle sleep and (forced) sleep are:
- Forced sleep occurs when the user takes some sort of direct action to cause the machine to sleep. Closing the lid on a laptop or selecting sleep from the Apple menu both cause forced sleep. The system will also induce forced sleep under certain conditions, for example, a thermal emergency or a low battery.
- Idle sleep occurs when the machine is unused for a specific period of time configured in the Energy Saver System Preferences
