## Notable
- RCE Via MSDT.EXE Follina
- A remote code execution vulnerability exists when MSDT is called using the URL protocol from a calling application such as Word.
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling application.
- The attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts in the context allowed by the user’s rights.

Example Command Line LOLBAS Project
```
msdt.exe /id PCWDiagnostic /skip force /param "IT_LaunchMethod=ContextMenu IT_BrowseForFile=/../../$(calc).exe"
```
