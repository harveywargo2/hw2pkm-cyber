## Adfind
AdFind is a command-line tool used to query Active Directory.

It's a versatile tool that can be used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious purposes, such as reconnaissance by attackers.

Attackers frequently use it to gather information about users, groups, and other objects within an Active Directory environment.

AdFind allows users to query Active Directory using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
