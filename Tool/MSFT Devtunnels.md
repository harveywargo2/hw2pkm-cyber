## Notable
A devtunnel (short for "developer tunnel") is a tool that creates a secure, public internet URL that tunnels traffic directly to a web service or application running on your local machine (localhost)

The Microsoft Dev Tunnels service is a popular implementation of this technology, often integrated directly into the Visual Studio and VS Code development environments.

A MSFT devtunnel (Microsoft Developer Tunnel) is a secure tunneling service provided by Microsoft that allows developers to expose a local web service or application (running on their machine, or localhost) to the public internet via a unique, public URL.

It is essentially a built-in, secure alternative to popular third-party tools like ngrok, designed to streamline development and debugging workflows, especially within the Microsoft ecosystem (Visual Studio, VS Code, Azure, Power Platform)
